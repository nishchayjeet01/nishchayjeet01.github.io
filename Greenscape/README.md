This is my official minor project for 3rd year of B.tech.
Its an API based web application with real time AQI and carbon emissions data that helps users reduce air pollution and carbon footprint.
To be precise, the app collects the real time data related to gaseous compositions and concentrations in the atmosphere, pollen rate and carbon emission 
from live open and governmental sources and gives users access to current regional AIR QUALITY INDEX and carbon footprint 
and based on the index instruct the users how they can contribute in reducing air pollution and carbon footprint
